# Teaching
<br style="clear: both">
I have a lot to say about teaching and I'm not nearly done.

## A High School History Teacher Writing About Teaching
In 2018, I wrote a few posts about teaching on [Medium](https://jonathanseyfried.medium.com/):
- ['You're a Racist!' Four Steps to Avoid Panic When Someone Calls You a Racist.](https://jonathanseyfried.medium.com/youre-a-racist-four-steps-to-avoid-panic-when-someone-calls-you-a-racist-b1be14aaec0c) June 14, 2018

My most important writing about high school teaching remains my teacher-biography of my friend and colleague, Devin J. Ayers. Devin passed away suddenly in January 2017 but will always be remembered as an exemplar of anti-authoritarian teaching and poetic iconoclast. The book is titled, *Unbounded Joy: The Life of a Teacher* and I hope that I will one day find a publisher to help bring Devin's experience to a wide audience of aspiring educators. There's a lot to learn from this inspirational figure who dreamed of teaching while working in a cranberry processing factory and then got his chance for seven beautiful years. You can get a small sampling of Devin's teaching [on one of his websites](https://devinjayers.weebly.com/) and also read one of his short fiction pieces on [Belletrist](https://belletristmagazine.com/author/devin/).

## Future Writing About Teaching
After completing my PhD in History, I would like to write a monograph on history teaching. I remain inspired by one of my professors from my Masters program, [Sam Wineburg](https://ed.stanford.edu/faculty/wineburg). Sam's work on historical thinking will always serve as a touchstone for me and I hope to contribute to this ongoing conversation. I'm hoping to dig in to questions on how historical content in particular connects to intrinsic motivation, curiosity, and self-empowerment.
